When I first heard the term coding standards, I imagined endless arguments about things like indentation or where to put a curly brace. Programmer level grammar debates. Not exactly thrilling stuff. But after spending a week using ESLint in VSCode while building out some small projects I think it's much more than that. Coding standards might sound boring on paper, but in practice they actually make coding more fun. Especially when you have the right tools in place.

## Making Clean Code Effortless (and Fun)

I use VSCode a lot. It’s my main workspace when I’m designing UI's and styling with CSS. When you’re bouncing between files and tweaking little visual elements, the last thing you want is messy code slowing you down. That’s where ESLint—and other VSCode extensions shine.
It’s honestly satisfying to watch those little red underlines disappear as you fix each issue. I didn’t expect to get muhc of a dopamine hit from cleaning up code, but it really felt nice fixing it up. It feels like each fix is a small win, and before you know it, you’ve got a perfectly formatted file that just feels right. 

## Learning with ESLint

I think ESLint helped me learn JavaScript more deeply. It caught things I didn’t know were problematic like accidental global variables or unclear syntax. It nudged me toward better habits. I found myself Googling less and understanding more, just from paying attention to the linting suggestions. 

What makes this whole process enjoyable is how integrated everything is in VSCode. I’ve added a few helpful extensions like Prettier for formatting and they make the coding workflow smooth and responsive. I think quick iteration is key. I can design, tweak, and test without getting tripped up by forgotten semicolons or inconsistent variable names. It keeps me in the zone, and I actually enjoy the rhythm of writing and then having the ability to quickly move on to checking errors.

## In Conclusion

If I had to pick one software engineering practice to stick with long term, it would absolutely be coding standards. They help learn, they make my code easier to understand, and thanks to tools like ESLint I think coding is a more enjoyable process.

Coding standards may not sound exciting, but once you start using them in your projects, they become part of the fun.
