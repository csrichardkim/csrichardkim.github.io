Artificial Intelligence has become a common presence in education and many people are seeking to maximize its benefits. However, the issue many find themselves in is overreliance. The reason for this common occurance is not because AI isn't a great learning tool, it's because many users take the wrong approach to using AI. To incorporate these amazing tools into our learning space we have to approach AI as a collaborative partner. In order to work with AI we have to let them shine in the parts they’re best at.

In ICS 314, I have used multitudes of AI tools most of which were Claude and GitHub Copilot. I’ve used different prompts from clarifying and explaining to a “do this” approach. I found from these experiences that there is a way to use AI that benefits everyone’s learning process. Below, I reflect on each course element and describe how I did or did not use AI, providing specific prompts and examples where possible.

**Experience WODs**

For Experience WODs. Upon finding an issue or gap in my knowledge I would watch the provided screencast solutions first. If the screencast didn’t fully answer my question, I would check related threads on Stack Overflow. And then finally AI tools. 
AI shines here because 1) it’s specific to what I’m curious about, and 2) it's not my first choice. Due to AI’s quick lookup nature, it's very convincing to us that AI should be the first means of resource. However, it will not always be the best. Realizing you have options is powerful, and searching for something you’re curious about is a skill all software engineers need. 

**In-class WODs**

When using AI to actually code, the amount of code you should prompt them with is important. 
Since most of the assignments this semester were online, it was really easy for me to fall into the pigeon hole of managing AI to complete them. However, you quickly realize that AI tools are bad at writing high level code. You can probably prompt them with your entire assignment and get lucky, but more often than not, the code they give you will have bugs that  in order to solve, you need to know how to do the assignment. It’s a potential waste of time and efficiency for them to do everything.

The way AI should be shining here is either to recall syntax, or structuring your code. For example, instead of asking them to fix your a home page component align with the center which is very specific, you could ask your AI tool:

“What is the Bootstrap 5 class for vertically centering text inside a column?”

Which might provide you with a similar answer to the first prompt, however the potential concepts you learn are reusable. The code AI gives you can be very specific and work in unique cases, which causes bugs. By grounding your questions to the core concepts,  you’re learning how to actually code whilst being efficient in finishing the assignment.

**Essays**

Essays are a good example of structure. It can be difficult when you’re unsure of where to start in your coding project or in this case essay. You could look at a variety of resources and look at similar design structures but it might not be exactly what you’re looking for. So AI here can be helpful to provide a roadmap of what you should be doing, and a layout of the different components of your project. AI shines here because it’s not building anything, but reinforcing the ideas you have in your head and works as an organizer to aid in planning. 

**Final Project**

Projects are where AI tools become most like a partner. You can use AI tools to provide a list of components and structure for your website reinforcing the prior planning you’ve done. You can use AI to provide syntax confusions and sometimes concepts that may be unfamiliar to you. In my case, AI often suggested debugging steps that I hadn’t thought of and that actually smoothened the process of debugging because it expanded my solving options. 

The main takeaway here is that in order for AI to shine, you have to choose what goes in and what goes out. The time AI starts to become problematic is the moment you hand them the reign of the decisions for your project. You are the creator and the one building the website, so give yourself more credit and take ownership of the things that you create. That way you can fully say that you created this.

My experience in ICS 314 showed me that AI’s impact on learning depends entirely on how it’s used. We’ve seen multiple examples of ways that minimizes the learning process with AI, and examples on making AI shine. We often times forget that we are constant learners ourselves. It’s important for all of us to take into consideration what AI offers us, but never put it above ourselves and what we capable of doing. AI will fully escape us in software engineering, and that is okay. As long as there is consciousness in the way we use and manage the tools given to us, we can only go up from here.
