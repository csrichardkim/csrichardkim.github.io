My first encounter with TypeScript was from the perspective of a student who had learned Java throughout college. 

Coming from an object oriented, strongly typed programming background, TypeScript was quite a nice surprise. Although it builds on top of JavaScript which is dynamically typed and loosely structured, TypeScript manages to bridge the gap between ease of scripting and the more serious aspects of formal software engineering. I quickly noticed that TypeScript function calls and class structures bore strong similarities to how Java handles object oriented design, which made the learning curve less steep and frankly enjoyable.


## Comparing the Two

I personally found the learning curve for TypeScript less steep than other languages, which is ironic considering how confusing a language JavaScript is. 

TypeScript, much like Java, allows for static type checking. In Java, you declare variables with specific types (e.g., String, int, double), and TypeScript brings this discipline to JavaScript with types like string, number, boolean, etc. This static typing makes both languages more robust, especially during development, as many errors are caught at compile time rather than at runtime. TypeScript also supports ES6-style classes, interfaces, inheritance, and access modifiers such as public, private, and protected, which Java developers are already familiar with.

Incorporating HTML also gave me the full toolkit to build an actual website from scratch. This was especially exciting because it allowed me to bring concepts to life visually, something I hadnâ€™t done much working in Java and something that introduced me to Computer Science in the first place.

## WOD

One of the most unique elements of this learning experience was the inclusion of WODs (Workouts of the Day). 

These practice exercises changed the way I approached coding. Rather than passive learning or cramming before deadlines, WODs forced me to treat programming like  training for a sports competition: consistent, timed, and structured. This style of learning felt more realistic and sustainable, especially in a field where skills need to be constantly sharpened.

It develops problem solving speed and accuracy under pressure, which mirrors real-world scenarios like coding interviews or sprint-based development work. Yes, it was stressful at times, but also incredibly rewarding. The structure helped me stay focused and develop a sense of discipline just like an athlete.


## In Conclusion

It's amazing to see how bits of pieces, whether from languages or concepts, ties into each other. This is what makes computer science so interesting and I can't wait to see how we can further incoorperate our knowledge into using typescript, and more. 

 

## Note on AI
I prompted Claude with my own typed answers to the essay's questions, and asked it to format my paragraphs into an essay. It provided the structure and additional grammatical checks. Mahalo for listening.
