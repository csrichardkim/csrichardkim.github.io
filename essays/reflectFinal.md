When I first started ICS 314, I thought the course would be about building web applications. That of course was true. It was an integral part of the experience. However, I realized that this class wasn't simply to learn how to create these mockup pages but really it's to get you to think like a software engineer. Understanding what to build and deciding how to get there in a systematic way are things outside a screen, but skills inside the field of software engineering. 

The start of the semester I was definitely in the headspace where I thought the syntax and tech stack being used was the most important thing to learn. Now that I've shifted my mindset to focusing more on the processes and practices of being a software engineer, the topics of the class feels a lot more digestable. I have noticed that building projects also tend feel more cohesive and I'm able to recognize patterns from other projects in the past. The syntax, the languages are all definitely needed tools, but to implement them is the most important thing. There are a few specific lessons I've learned in this class that I thought really emphasized these thoughts. The two includes design patterns and ethics. These are practices away from coding, and truly delves into things outside of just a classroom.

                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                    
### Design Patterns
<br>

The first concept that stood out to me was Design Patterns. These are essentially designing reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Rather than reinventing the wheel every time a problem comes up, design patterns provide proven approaches that make systems more organized and maintainable. 

Having structure and purpose in the way you build, makes it not only easier to add new features without accidentally breaking unrelated parts of the application, but it makes providing simple direction a lot more easy. Design Patterns are like the architects of building a road, and coding is the cement being used. Oftentimes you'll have a similar blueprint for different projects. The cement might be different, but the design process remains the same. 

I also truly believe this topic was useful in getting someone to think outside of just the final product. As a software engineer, you should be able to consider the entire landscape of what you are trying to create, and format it in a way of steps for people to understand. These steps means you know how to do something and you are able to put those thoughts into words.

                                                                                                                                                                                                        
### Ethics
<br>
              
Another major takeaway was the importance of Ethics in Software Engineering. There are a couple different types of ethics. One is security. Being able to avoid malicious code and understanding the potential impacts of your software are design decisions that protects users. 

The other type of ethics is workplace ethics. Development involves collaboration and software engineers have a social repsonsibility to the people they surround themselves with. These type of ethics delves beyond just a screen, it encapsulates the communication that needs to be dealt with in order for you to produce the best quality work. 

Knowing how to communicate with the users and know what product they want is important. Working alongside coworkers and understanding each others work makes everything run smoother. Doing all of this in a way that proceeds with kindness and efficiency, is something every engineer should be seeking to incorporate. So I definitely thought this was a topic different to web design, but tailored to the workplace eniornment. Having the intelligence on how actions affct things outside of code and with people, is something very important.

                                                                                                                                                                                        
### Beyond the Classroom
<br>
        
Design patterns provide structure and ethics ensures that the software benefits its users and society. The final key item that I think is the most important lesson from ICS 314 is the essence of learning. It's going beyond the classroom and actually building projects to get you that job. In computer science, and in fact most engineering classes, thye don't teach you the specifity of every single technology or every single line of code. It really is a set of concepts that are deriven from usability. So you may learn what an item does and when to use it, but not neccesarily how to use it. 

Software engineers are often associated with being a great learner. They have the ability to adapt and be constantly evolving as a learner. That takes outside work of the classroom and it is one of the most important skill to have. An example of why learning is important, is AI's constant adaptability rate. AI feels dangerous, and the reason for that is due to it's inherent nature of being to able to evolve. AI recognizes patterns and absorbs the data they recieve. The best engineers are those who recognizes these patterns the quickest, who organizes the knowledge they recieve, and are able to put what they learn into memory. 

ICS 314 incorporated all of these ideas and have definitley taught me more about engineering in it's entirety. 

Mahalo for listening.
