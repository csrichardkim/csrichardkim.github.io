Positive Punishment is a chrome extension timer that generates AI made insults to help motivate students. 
The idea originated from my friend who needed honest and brutal motivation to push them to complete thier college assignments. 
It's layout components are made through HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The texts are pulled from a JS API and the images are googled gifs. 
The files are also accessible as a zip-file for anyone to plug in as their own custom chrome extension.

This was my first project incoorperating these languages, and it now keeps me motivated as a student.
