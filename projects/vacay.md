DinoRun is a simple game made for my SPED201 final project. It's a walkthrough on how developers can create applications whilst keeping accessibility in mind. It showcases visual, audio, and motor accessibility features all under the 'option' menu. It also has a voice control option in which you can play the game using your voice. 

It is implemented using a no coding game engine named GDevelop, although some JavaScript was used for some game mechanics.

In this project I gained experience with accessibiltiy. A topic that is an undermined, but important in the way we create.
