DinoRun is a simple game made for my SPED201 final project. It's designed to be a walkthrough on how developers can create gaming applications while keeping accessibility in mind. It showcases common  visual, audio, and motor features all under the option menu. When you hover above each accessibiliy option a 'learn more' button will appear which directs you to a screen with more information regarding the chosen option.

The two most notable features of the game is it's character selection option, and a voice control option in which you can play the game using your voice.

It is implemented using a no coding game engine named GDevelop, although some JavaScript was used for some game mechanics. The sprites were taked from the game engine itself.

In this project I gained experience with accessibiltiy and researched in how to produce usable applications that is inclusive to the most amount of people. A topic that is an undermined, but important in the way we create. 

If you are interested on this topic here is a slideshow created as my presentation.
