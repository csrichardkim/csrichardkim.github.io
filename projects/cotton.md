summary: "A weather app that I developed for ICS 211"
---

In this project, I created a simple console based Weather App using Java. The app prompts the user to enter a city name, then uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch  weather data for that location. I built the HTTP request using Javaâ€™s HttpURLConnection and read the API response. The response, which is in JSON format, is parsed using the org.json library to extract and display key weather details like temperature and conditions. 

This project demonstrates how to integrate a third party API in Java and handle JSON data and was a final project for ICS 211
